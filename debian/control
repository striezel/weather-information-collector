Description: Collects information from various weather APIs
 weather-information-collector is a tool that collects weather information from
 various available ReST API services (currently OpenWeatherMap, Apixu, DarkSky
 and Weatherbit) and stores the information in a database. Currently only MySQL
 and compatible DBMS like MariaDB are supported.
 Data collection tasks can be configured individually.
